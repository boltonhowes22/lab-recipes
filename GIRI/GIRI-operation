# GIRI Operation

#### Basic Operation:
1.	Measure coolant depth (no lower than 6”)
2.	If the wheel has not run in a few hours, allow it to run for 20 mins to rebalance **Note: Glasses on while wheel is running**
3.	Check refractometry rating (should be around 2.
4.	Sometimes check pH (9 to 10, higher is better)
5.	Sometimes check hardness (~250)
6.	Check alkalinity (greater than 240)
Note: with all metrics, stability is more important than being at a certain number
7.	Wipe down roller
8.	Make sure roller will not get snagged on black backing
9.	Push ‘Start’
10.	Write in log
11.	Ensure there is enough hard drive space for all captures
12.	Restart capture 1
13.	Type commands into Matlab

#### Mixing and adding Coolant:
1)	Depending on desired volume of coolant, pour DI into bucket
2)	Add coolant at 2.5% concentration (always put DI in bucket and add coolant to it)
3)	Stir
4)	Pour into machine.

When in the field:
1)	Orient samples by selecting flat surface on sample and taking its strike and dip.
