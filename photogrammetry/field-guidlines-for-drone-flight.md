# Guidelines and Helpful Info for Flying the Drone

### Before leaving princeton


### GCPs
- bring or purchase blue tarps from a hardware stores
- if you don't have enough space for tarps, you can use natural landmarks, but make sure they are really big (meter scale) landmarks
- try to put GCPs in the corners of the flight areas
- if you are placing the tarps, bring the Trimble with you and take the trimble points as you set out the tarps
- Cars make excellent GCPs--But you have to make sure they aren't moving during the flight (Don't use Frederik's car as a GCP)

### Preflight
- Put in a new SD card
- Turn on the radio transmitter
- Take off the lens cap

### If the drone crashes
- look at the last known GPS location in eMotion

### Processing data in the field
