# Sample Prep for Analysis on the Sercon

## Sawing and Polishing
1. Tile Saw – used to cut fresh surfaces in hand samples.

  a. Turn on the water using the yellow lever to the right of the saw – the lever does not need to be turned all the way to on. The saw is cooled using water, so ensure there is at least a light stream of water running over the blade before turning on the saw.

  b. Place sample on the cutting table, flattest side down. Turn on the saw using the switch to the left of the blade, and make two parallel cuts, making sure the slab is thick enough to drill without breaking into fragments under pressure. For smaller samples, ensure that the slab is roughly the same width and height. Turn off the blade between samples, and remove any sample fragments from the cutting table.

  **Note: The saw blade is not sharp, but diamond tipped, which means that it will not cut your finger, but will cut through your nail. Be careful, and always keep your nails far away, or facing away from the blade. The hose at the back of the metal pan in which the saw sits will occasionally get clogged with fine silt. Watch the water level in the pan to ensure it does not overflow. If the water level gets close to the top of the pan, turn off the water and use your finger to unclog the inside of the hose.**

2. Oil Saw – used to cut fresh surfaces in larger samples

  a. With the saw turned off, and the lever in “return” position, open the top of the saw. Pull the sample stage away from the blade and place your sample on it. Ensure that the sample is tightly secured, flattest side down, and will not move when the saw is running – movement will give uneven surfaces.

  b. Once the sample is tightly secured, close the top of the saw (pull the hinge that props it open towards yourself), put the lever in “cut” position, and press start. The saw can run unattended and will take 15-25 minutes to saw through the sample depending on size.

  **Note: Since this is an oil saw, the sawed sample will be coated with oil. Soak it in warm soapy water to remove all oil residue before proceeding with polishing or drilling. If your sample is porous, consider the implications of filling pore spaces with oil (which will have some Carbon signature) before using the oil saw.**

3. Polisher – used to polish non-homogenous samples to distinguish between clasts and matrix while drilling

  a. Make sure all samples are well labeled on multiple sides.

  b. Evenly spread one cup of silicon carbide over the polishing tray, and pour a thin layer of water over it.

  c. Turn on the polisher using the black switch (hanging) by the bucket of rock waste. Don’t stand or lean in too close as silicon carbide water splashes out.

  d. Put a Sharpie line across the sample, and place the samples Sharpie-side down on polishing tray.

  e. Turn on, checking periodically, and adding silicon carbide and water as necessary.

  f. Samples are polished when the Sharpie line is gone.

  Note: It is important that polishing surface is completely flat, otherwise the sample will be unevenly polished. If you need to flatten your rock more, use wet/dry sandpaper (in room 215, drawer below He flush needles) to create a flat, polished surface.

  g. It is important to clean and completely dry the polishing table after each use. Using some paper towels, remove and dry the rubber ring in the polisher.

  h. Use a sponge to absorb most of the liquid remaining on the polishing table, then hose dry any remaining liquid (using the extendable air hose over the work table). Pay attention to this step since improper drying will rust the polisher

## 4. Drilling
  Used to produce powders for running on the Sercon for C and O isotopes
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Ensure the drill is clean and has the right sized drill bit before you start. The chuck is latched on the top left of the drill. The stage can be adjusted by unlocking the red turn key on the left of the drill, and then using the crank on the right to move the stage up or down. Make sure to lock the turn key after adjustment to avoid movement of the stage during drilling.</li>
    <li>Drill a shallow hole in sample (< 1-2mm). Usually, the best places to drill are the most homogenous areas of the sample. However, it may sometimes be necessary to sample from clasts, fossils, different colored matrices, or other heterogeneities, based on your project goals.</li>
    <li>Multiple drill holes may be required to obtain enough powder for analyses. Use weighing paper to transfer powder into plastic vials. Make sure vials are labeled legibly on cap and side.</li>
    <li>Use the air hose to clean the drill bit, and drilling surface in between every sample.</li>
    <li>If the sample is not flat, place it on the red beanbags for support.</li>
    <li>Sometimes, the head of a used drill bit might break if too much pressure is applied, while drilling on a sloping rock surface. When this happens, the head flies off, downslope. Always ensure that sloping rock surfaces are sloping away from you, and wear safety glasses to avoid injury.</li>

## 5. Weighing samples for Sercon

a. Air hose the table and lay out kimwipes as your “clean surface”.

b. Determine which vials in the rack will be used for standards. To ensure reliable data, space standards every 5 vials. Follow diagram below for standard order, samples will occupy the blank spaces. Run order is right to left from the bottom to top most row (in diagram).

| N 	|   	|   	|   	|   	|   	| V 	|   	|   	|   	|     	|     	|
|:-:	|:-:	|:-:	|:-:	|:-:	|:-:	|:-:	|:-:	|:-:	|:-:	|:---:	|:---:	|
| V 	|   	|   	|   	|   	|   	| V 	|   	|   	|   	|     	|     	|
| N 	|   	|   	|   	|   	|   	| V 	|   	|   	|   	|     	|     	|
| N 	|   	|   	|   	|   	|   	| V 	|   	|   	|   	|     	|     	|
| V 	|   	|   	|   	|   	|   	| V 	|   	|   	|   	|     	|     	|
| N 	|   	|   	|   	|   	|   	| V 	|   	|   	| V 	| CMT 	| CMT 	|

c. If you will be using the Sercon for more than a single run, you MUST conduct a test run to determine the number of divots of VTS standard needed, to get a feel for the right amount of NBS, and to determine appropriate sample amounts, using a few randomly selected samples – if sample compositions/mineralogy vary, test a range of samples, since different sample mineralogies react differently with acid.

d. For the NBS standard, weigh out 20–30 grains. Use the black well to weigh out ~2 (tightly packed)/3 (loosely packed) divots of the VTS standard. Make sure vials are clearly labeled. Note: the sensitivity of the Sercon changes whenever the filament is replaced, or the source is cleaned, which may change the amounts of standards required. A standard run, of 10-12 standards (7 VTS, 3 NBS, 2 Test-CMT) must be run to confirm standard amounts, and to ensure that the instrument is running smoothly and producing reliable data.

e. Use the black well to weigh out 1–3 divots worth of each sample (depending on amounts determined from test run), clearly labeling the vials. The necessary amount of powder for each sample is dependent on its carbonate content, as well as the sensitivity of the machine. Most samples require 2 divots, unless a test run shows otherwise.

f. Allow rack to sit in oven for at least an hour to remove any moisture from the samples.
