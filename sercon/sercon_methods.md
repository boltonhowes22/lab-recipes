# Sample Prep for Analysis on the Sercon

## 1. Cut   

  Before you begin, determine which machine is best suited to your sample. The **tile saw** is used to cut fresh surfaces in hand samples. Anything larger can be cut using the **oil saw**. If your sample is porous, consider the implications of filling pore spaces with oil (which will have some Carbon signature) before using the oil saw. Wear safety glasses and ear protection for this procedure.

  ### Tile Saw

  a. Turn on the water using the yellow lever to the back-right of the saw. Ensure there is a light stream of water running over the blade before turning on the saw. **The saw floods very easily** so leave the water on for as short a time as possible.

  b. Place sample on the cutting table flattest side down. Recall that you're hoping to cut a sample thick enough to drill without breaking into fragments under pressure.

  c. With the sample not touching the blade, turn on the saw using the black switch.

  d. Slowly slide the sample through the blade, making two parallel cuts. Note that the blade is diamond tipped, meaning it will not cut your finger if you touch it, but it will cut through your nail.   

  e. Turn off the blade and the water between samples, and remove any sample fragments from the cutting table.

  #### Common Problems
  The hose at the back of the metal pan in which the saw sits will occasionally get clogged with fine silt. Use your finger to unclog the inside of the hose.

### Oil Saw

  a. With the saw turned off, and the lever in “return” position, open the top of the saw. Pull the sample stage away from the blade and place your sample on it. Ensure that the sample is tightly secured, flattest side down, and will not move when the saw is running.

  b. Once the sample is tightly secured, close the top of the saw (pull the hinge that props it open towards yourself), put the lever in “cut” position, and press start. The saw can run unattended.

  c. Once you hear that the saw has completely finished its cut, open the top of the saw and remove your sample.

  d.The sawed sample will be coated with oil. Scrub/soak it with warm soapy water to remove all oil residue before proceeding with polishing or drilling.

## 2. Polish  
Polish non-homogenous samples to distinguish between clasts and matrix while drilling

  a. Ensure samples are clearly labeled on multiple sides and that the polishing surface is completely flat. If you need to flatten your sample, use wet/dry sandpaper.

  b. Evenly spread one cup of silicon carbide over the polishing tray, and pour a thin layer of water over it.

  c. Turn on the polisher using the black switch (hanging) by the bucket of rock waste. Silicon carbide water splashes out, so don't stand too close.

  d. Draw a black line across the sample using a Sharpie, and place the samples line-side down on the polishing tray.

  e. Turn on, checking periodically, and adding silicon carbide and water as necessary. Samples are polished when the black line is gone.

  g. Clean and dry the polisher. Using paper towels, remove and dry the rubber ring in the polisher. Absorb most of the liquid remaining on the polishing table using a sponge. Hose dry any remaining liquid (using the extendable air hose over the work table). Improper drying will rust the polisher.

## 3. Drill
  Used to produce powders for running on the Sercon for C and O isotopes. Wear safety glasses for this procedure.

  a. Ensure the drill is clean and has the right-sized drill bit. The chuck is latched on the top left of the drill, and it can be used to change the drill bit.  

  b. If necessary, adjust the stage by unlocking the red turn key on the left of the drill and turning the crank on the right. Lock the turn key after adjustment.

  c. Place sample on the stage, ensuring the flat side is flush to the stage surface. If the sample is not flat, place it on red bean bags for support. Always ensure that sloping rock surfaces are sloping away from you to avoid injury.

  c. Drill a shallow hole in sample (< 1-2mm). The best places to drill are often the most homogenous areas of the sample. Note that this can vary from project to project - it may be necessary to sample from clasts, fossils, or other heterogeneities. Multiple drill holes may be required to obtain enough powder for analyses.  

  d. Ensure plastic sample vials are clearly labeled on cap and side, and use weighing paper to transfer powder into vials.

  e. Use the air hose to clean the drill bit, and drilling surface in between every sample.

  #### Common Problems

  The head of a used drill bit might break if too much pressure is applied. When this happens, the head flies off, downslope. Always ensure that sloping rock surfaces are sloping away from you.

## 4. Weighing samples
During this step, you will weigh out samples for sercon analysis. **Note that procedures for standards are highly subject to change.**

a. Locate clean sample vials on the lower shelf of the oven. Bring vials to your weighing space (to the right of drill).

b. Air hose the table and wipe down the surface with kim wipes.

c. Determine the layout of your standards and samples by following the diagram below, and clearly label the vials as such. Samples will occupy the blank spaces. Run order is right to left from the bottom to top most row.

| N 	|   	|   	|   	|   	|   	| V 	|   	|   	|   	|     	|     	|
|:-:	|:-:	|:-:	|:-:	|:-:	|:-:	|:-:	|:-:	|:-:	|:-:	|:---:	|:---:	|
| V 	|   	|   	|   	|   	|   	| V 	|   	|   	|   	|     	|     	|
| N 	|   	|   	|   	|   	|   	| V 	|   	|   	|   	|     	|     	|
| N 	|   	|   	|   	|   	|   	| V 	|   	|   	|   	|     	|     	|
| V 	|   	|   	|   	|   	|   	| V 	|   	|   	|   	|     	|     	|
| N 	|   	|   	|   	|   	|   	| V 	|   	|   	| V 	| CMT 	| CMT 	|


d. For the NBS standard, weigh out 15–20 grains using the metal scooping tool. This is a scoop and look technique, and it is quite approximate.  

e. For the VTS standard, use the black well to weigh out two (tightly packed) to three (loosely packed) "divots". If it is your first time using the VTS standard, weigh out three divots.

f. Place the well over the vial with the divot side facing down. Tap the top of the well to ensure all of the powder enters the vial.

g. For the CMT standard, weigh out one divot. Repeat step f.  

e. When weighing samples, use the black well to weigh out one to three divots. The necessary amount of powder for each sample is dependent on its carbonate content, as well as the sensitivity of the machine. Most samples require two divots, unless a test run shows otherwise.

f. Allow rack of vials to sit in oven for at least an hour to remove any moisture from the samples.

# Mass Spectrometer Analysis - Starting and Monitoring a Run

## 1. Load Acid
Wear gloves for this procedure

a. Under the hood, unwrap the para-film sealing the acid container.

b.Using a small plastic funnel, slowly pour acid into a small glass vial, filling it to the top.  

c. Cap the vial and place it in the heating block in the columns to the far right.   

## 2. Flush
a.	Remove the rack of vials from the oven. Partially screw on the caps for all tubes, using different colored caps for standards and samples. Caps should be screwed on just enough so you can pick up the vial using only the cap. It is good practice to randomly cap vials to eliminate potential for systematic isotope fractionation due to exposure to moisture in the air.

b.	Systematically go through and tighten each cap. When tightening the caps, tighten until you notice a divot forming in the septum. Then, loosen slightly until there is no divot.

c. At the He flush station, insert loose needles into the edge of the septa. Avoid puncturing the middle. Discard any bent/broken needles in the red sharps box by the flush station.

d. Insert flush needles into horizontal vials, starting at the pressure gauge, and ensuring that the flush needles only puncture the edge of the septa. The flush needles are connected in a series-circuit style. This means they should always be added to the system in sequential order (starting at the first needle) and be removed in reverse order. Following a different order could contaminate the vials with atmospheric air.

e. Any flush needles that aren’t puncturing vials should be capped with gray, circular rubber stoppers.

f. Turn on He (taller tank to the right) in the closet, using the left most knob on the regulator, and the knob on the tank. Turn pressure gauge on flush needles to approximately 80 psi.

g. Flush vials for about 8 min.

h. Leaving the He on until all vials are removed, remove vials in reverse succession.  

i. Once all the vials have been removed, turn off the He pressure gauge only - a full run requires two rounds of He flushing. The pressure gauge for the He flush needles should be turned off while putting on the next set of vials, however, the He tank can remain on during that time. If you are doing a smaller run, you may skip this step.

j. After all the vials in the run have been He flushed and disconnected from the He flush needles, the pressure gauge should be turned to 0 and both knobs on He tank should be closed.

k. Remove all loose needles from the vials before loading samples into the heating block.

## 2. Loading Samples
a.	Open Callisto1055 program.

b. Click Sample List in upper left corner, and the previous sample list will pop up.

c.	Rewrite sample list with new sample names. The program does not support decimal points, and so may suggest reviewing errors in the list, if you accept errors, it will automatically correct decimal points to underscores.The last two columns should read: Weight = 100, Set Up = CTC-8. The last row should have the sample name “END”, Weight = 0, and Set Up should be empty.

d.	Save As a new file with the format mmddyy_ABC (ABC = your initials).

e.	Load vials row by row into heating block in same order as entered into the sample list. Keep the lid on the heating block as much as possible while loading since heat is lost very quickly.

f.	Allow heating block temperature to equilibrate to 69–71°C, to avoid fractionation of oxygen isotopes during acidification. This temperature can be reached faster by insulating the heating block with foil.

## 3. Acidification
Use gloves when completing this procedure.

a. Remove two small needles from the bag of small blue needles, and a syringe from the box in the right most, under bench storage closet. Tighten the needle on the syringe to avoid leaks.

b. Prior to acidifying, use a small blue needle to puncture the edge of the septa of each vial to release pressure.

c. Remove the acid vial from the heating block after the acid has heated for at least 1-2 hours.

d.	Insert small needle into the edge of the septum on the acid vial to allow for air to flow in as acid is drawn.

e. Puncture the other edge of the septum with syringe. Holding the vial upside down, draw in acid. A full run (72 vials) needs close to two full syringes for acidification.

f.After drawing acid, return the acid vial to the block, to keep it warm (and less viscous).

g. Holding the syringe needle vertically, with a kimwipe wrapped around the top, slowly press the plunger to remove any bubbles. If bubbles remain behind, pull back the plunger to create an air pocket, and then repeat the process until no bubbles remain (in the syringe or in the green neck of the needle).

h. Starting at beginning of run, puncture the bottom left corner of the septa (see figure below), inserting enough acid to react with the sample completely. This is generally about 3 drops or half the distance between the markings on they syringe. Angle the needle towards the vial wall so that the acid flows down the side of the vial. This is crucial so that the acid warms up as it drips down the side, and reacts properly with sample. Keep count of the acidified vials.

![septa figure](/sercon/images/septafig.png)

i. If there are any visible drops of acid on the septum, wipe them off with a q-tip before starting the run.

j. Start the run 1.5-2 hours after the first sample was acidified. This allows for most of the samples to dissolve completely.

#### Mixing Acid
Follow this procedure when there are multiple vials of acid in the heating block or we are running low on acid.

a. Once there are a few vials of used acid in the block, empty them into the acid container.

b. Place container on the hot plate in the hood at 150˚. Cover with a watchglass and stir with stirring rod until the mixture looks homogenous, then let it cool to room temperature.

c. Pour acid into a plastic measuring cylinder and use the hydrometer (in drawer labeled foil/tape) to measure the density. If the density is between 1.9 and 1.95, pour the acid into the container, and seal it. If not, add a small amount of phosphorous pentoxide, mix until dissolved, then cool and re-measure density.

d. When acid runs out, follow instructions taped to the hood to make a new batch of acid – wear gloves, and a lab coat while dealing with phosphoric acid and phosphorous pentoxide. Always start with ~50% phosphoric acid volumetrically, since phosphorous pentoxide will increase total volume i.e. for 100 ml of acid, start with ~50ml of  phosphoric acid.

## 4. Starting the Sercon

a. Wipe the sampling needle clean with a kimwipe. Change out the septa in the He flush valve on the left side (new septa can be found in the drawer just below the keyboard).

b. Record He, and Ref1 values from the gas bench in the lab book.

c.	Record the vacuum reading from the program (as a fraction A/S), and the reading on the He tank on the right wall of the closet.

d.	In the source control window on the right, click Load, then select “CO2.src”

e.	Turn on CO2 by clicking the CO2 tank on the mass spec diagram and wait for the mass 44, 45, and 46 (colored bars) to stabilize. Record those values.

f.	Click “peak 2”, and then “center” once the graph appears. This checks whether the magnet is centered. If the magnet is centered, there will be a green line at the center of the curve. If not, two lines, a red and a green, will appear. The green line is the center. Click “Enable” on the source control window, and use the right most single arrows to move the red line. A black line appears to show the direction in which the line is moving. Re-center if needed and save (rewrite) CO2.src if the HT value was changed. If the value was changed, re-check the center after saving the file.

g. Record HT, HP, Focus, Trap, eV, IR from the source control window.

h.	Close CO2 by clicking button on diagram again.

i.	Click “Start” (top left), and make sure it has the correct sample list name (mmddyy_ABC). Okay the file name, then source file, tick the box for stand-by, and okay the last window.

j.	The run will start, and graphs will appear in the middle window. Click “Toolbar” then “Set axes”, click save and exit, and then “Redraw” to properly scale the peaks.

k.	The first five peaks (square) are reference peaks. Record “load” and “inject” values from the flowmeter for the first non-reference (curved peak) at the start of the run.

l.	Compare all values recorded in the lab notebook to previous values. Notify the appropriate person if you notice a difference in these values.

m.	Periodically record tuning parameters in “Sercon tuning log” Excel spreadsheet on the Mac by the scopes.

## 5. Monitoring run

a. Ensure that at least the first two curved peaks look normal

b. Check sercon periodically, but it can be left alone overnight.

c. After the run has been completed, change out the septa in the He flush valve on the left side (new septa can be found in the drawer below the keyboard). Make sure the septa isn’t screwed on too tight (the septa should not be convex).

# Mass Spectrometer Analysis - Data Reduction

a. Open the Reprocessor and use the “Replay” button to find and open your file. If the Reprocessor was open, your file will not appear the first time you hit “Replay”. You will need to close the Replay window and reopen it to find your file.

b.	Go through the non-reference (curved) peaks for all samples and check that they are approximately the size of the reference peaks. Any peaks that are too low might correspond with popped caps, broken vials or undissolved sample. Peaks that are too high or too low will likely yield data with high standard deviations, and may need to be re-run.

c. Leave vials in heating block while reducing data to corroborate any anomalous values with vial order, popped caps, broken vials, etc.

d. The Sercon computer is not connected to the Internet. Save the “mmddyy_ABC.prn” file for the run onto a flash drive. The file can be found in a folder within the “Replay shortcut” folder on the desktop.

e. All data reduction is done on the Mac by the scopes. Drag and drop the .prn file into the “Raw Data” folder in Matlab.

f. Switch to the “Original_Sercon_Code” folder. Run the script “sercon.m” using the following command: sercon('mmddyy_ABC.prn',a,b) where mmddyy_ABC is the filename, a is the number of samples in the run, and b is the desired starting sample (almost always 1).

g.	A 5-subplot figure will be presented. The histogram in the lower left corner illustrates the occurrence of peak areas for each sample/standard. The peak area is the amount of gas collected for that measurement. The scatter plots (subplots 1-4) show peak area vs. raw ratio of carbon and oxygen isotopes for the standards.

h.	Select the peaks to include in the reduction. As the isotopic ratio for each peak is partly dependent on peak area, it is important to exclude any peaks that are too small or too large, since including them could produce large standard deviations.

i.	Click on the histogram to select the peak areas that will be used for data reduction, starting with the lower-bound (left) and ending with the upper-bound (right). This will need to be done twice, once for carbon isotopes and once for oxygen. It is best to exclude the tail ends of the sample peak area distribution. Ideally, there will be a Gaussian distribution of peak sizes.

j. A new 4-subplot figure will appear. The top two plots illustrate the raw carbon and oxygen values of each peak of each NBS standard, while the bottom two depict the same for the VTS standards.

k. Matlab will give the prompt “Exclude any NBS?”
Exclude any NBS standard that does not fit a line of best fit with the other standards, either with regard to carbon or oxygen isotopes.  

l. Matlab will then give the prompt “Exclude any VTS?” Repeat step k for VTS.

#### Common Problems - Steps j-l

a. The machine is tuned to optimize accuracy over a certain range of peak sizes. If the peak area is way too small or way too large relative to the reference peaks, it can be out of range for how the machine is tuned and won’t produce accurate data. If the sample just prior to a standard has a peak size that is way too large, it can overload the collector and influence the results.

b. If the sample was not acidified completely or acidified at the incorrect temperature, it might have fractionated away from the standard’s reported value.

c. If a cap pops off, the seal is broken and atmospheric air flows in. The CO2 gas produced from the reaction of acid and sample may leak out and the machine then measures air. Because air has much less carbon than CaCO3, the peak size will be extremely small. This is probably the most common error.

d. If the needle or tubing is clogged with septa or acid then not all of the gas will reach the collector.

e. If a flush needle is leaking, then atmospheric air will still be in your vial and it won’t have completely flushed with He, meaning it will slightly change the overall measurement.

Proper sized sample peaks

## Data Reduction Continued

m. 4 new figures will pop up. They are stacked, so move the figures apart to see all of them. Figure 1 shows all of the standards included in the reduction. Use this graph to answer the prompt: “Which is the primary standard?” This will be the standard that the data is corrected to in the case of a single point correction. Use the standard with the most data points as the primary standard, as it will be more statistically robust.

n. Figure 2 shows those standards if they were to be adjusted using the linearity defined by the NBS standard slope. Essentially, Matlab is determining the slope of the line of best fit through the NBS data and rotating it to horizontal. It then translates this line up or down to pin it to the known value of the standard, and then makes this correction for all NBS data (top two graphs) and all VTS data (bottom two graphs). This is a way to correct our data so that the isotope values are no longer biased towards peak area. Figure 3 shows the same thing but using the VTS slope. Figure 4 uses a slope that is the average of the NBS and VTS slope.  

o. Determine which slope best represents your data. The slope correction that minimizes standard deviations for carbon and oxygen will be the most accurate correction. Sigma values should be 0.1 or lower for carbon and 0.25 or lower for oxygen.

p. Matlab will give the prompt: “Which slope should we use?” Enter N, V, or mu (mu = μ = average) depending on which slope is most accurate to reduce data with.

q. You will be presented with a final figure containing two subplots. The knick point in each plot (y = 0) is the known value for the primary standard.

r.	Use the graph to estimate the difference between TP and SP for the secondary standard. Do this by first locating the value of your secondary standard on the x axis. Then, see where this x value intersects the plot. Ideally, the y value (difference) should be < 0.1 for d13C and < 0.25 for d18O, which indicates that the standards are in agreement. In this scenario, it is best to reduce the data using a TP correction. If the difference is much greater than this range, it is best to make a SP correction. Enter TP or SP for prompt “Two-point or Single-point correction?”

Note: If you are unsure about which correction to use, try reducing the data twice, once with each type of correction. Use whichever method produces the most consistent standard values, or rerun if neither creates reliable standards.

s. Final dataset will be produced. Several files recording all of the selections you made are saved. Open and examine the file "reduced_mmddyy_ABC.csv" in excel (open outside MATLAB).

t. Standards are expected to have the following values:

VTS: -1.48 ± 0.1 for d13C and -8.54 ± 0.25 for d18O

NBS: 1.95 ± 0.1 for d13C and -2.20  ± 0.25 for d18O

u.	Investigate any anomalous data points, by cross-referencing peak shape/size on the Reprocessor software. Consider rerunning samples if standards do not fit constraints or if there appears to be drift in standard values throughout the course of the run.

v.	Record standard values and data reduction parameters in “Standards” Excel spreadsheet.

# Common Problems

## Popped cap
Some of the vials have faulty threads that are incompatible with the caps, which can lead to caps “popping off” in the heating block as the plastic heats up and expands.

#### Symptoms:
This is easily identified using the Callisto Reprocessor software. The peaks for these samples will be completely flat lined, except for perhaps a small first peak.

![popped cap figure](/sercon/images/poppedcappeaksfig.png)
Diagnostic peak shape of a popped cap

#### Solution:
Identify vial in heating block and check to see if cap is crooked or loosely sitting on the vial. Remove the vial, wash out the acid with DI and put the vial in the broken glass box by the sink. Sometimes, the caps may be faulty. In that case, use those caps for acid vials and not for samples or standards.

Samples without any carbonate content or caps that are not screwed on completely can also give the same diagnostic signal in Callisto Reprocessor. Ensure this is not the case before throwing out a good vial.

## Clogs

Clogs can cause a spectrum of problems for the Sercon. Minor clogs, caused by pieces of septa or a thin meniscus of acid blocking part of the needle, are usually resolved on their own when the acid is pushed through to the trap. Clogs in the needle can be easily cleaned out. Acid clogs can create serious issues for the Sercon if they make it to the gas bench. This requires a lot a work to locate and clean out the acid, which blocks gas flow and corrodes parts of the machine.

#### Symptoms:
Clogs create variable data, as isotopic fractionation occurs when CO2 is not allowed to flow freely through the capillaries. Clogs are identified by irregular peak sizes and sporadic measurements from the flow meter. Take care to inject vials properly during acidification; improper acidification technique is the leading cause of clogs.

![clog peak figure](/sercon/images/clogpeakfig.png)
Irregular peak size indicative of a clog



![clog figure](/sercon/images/chronicclogfig.png)
Chronic clogs can also be identified during the data reduction process. Figure depicts distinct groupings of standards, which also show a gradual increase in value over the course of the run.
#### Solutions:

Contact the Lab Manager

## Unmixed acid

Always acidify using a vial of fresh acid. Combining the remaining acid from previous vials without proper heating and mixing can create variable data (see figure below).

Highly variable standards coincident with recycling remaining acid from previous runs
